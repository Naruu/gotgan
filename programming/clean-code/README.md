- small things matter
- 80% or more of what we do is "maintenance"
- consistent indentation style was one of the most significant indicator of low bug report
- the design lives in the code
- design as a process not a static endpoint.
- Did we do our best to leave the campground cleaner than we found it?
- Neither architecture nor clean code insist on perfection, only honesty and doing the best we can
